#### Description: 
QuackList is a simple task management web application developed as the final project for the CS50 course. Users can easily add, update, and delete tasks through an intuitive interface. Built using Flask and SQLAlchemy, QuackList provides a seamless user experience for organizing tasks efficiently. With QuackList, every task can get its 'ducks in a row'.

The project consists of the following files:

- **app.py**: This file contains the main Flask application, including routes for adding, updating, and deleting tasks.
- **base.html**: The HTML template file responsible for rendering the main layout of the application, including the header, task form, and task list.
- **styles.css**: Custom CSS styles to enhance the visual appeal and layout of the application.
- **db.sqlite**: The SQLite database file where task data is stored.

Design choices were made to ensure a user-friendly experience while keeping the application lightweight and responsive. Flask was chosen as the web framework for its simplicity and flexibility, while SQLAlchemy provided an easy-to-use ORM for database interactions. Semantic UI was used for styling due to its modern design and responsive components. SQLite was selected as the database engine for its lightweight nature and seamless integration with Flask applications.
